          </p>
          <p><em>Cookies and Tracking Technology</em></p>
          <p>
            We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences
            and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general
            usage and volume statistical information that does not include
            personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use another company to place cookies on your computer to collect
            non-personally identifiable information to compile aggregated
            statistics for us about visitors to our site.
          </p>
          <p><em>Web Beacons</em></p>
          <p>
            Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons
            (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies
            to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and
            may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and
            links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the
            effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing
            campaigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Web pages may also contain electronic images known as Web
            beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that are set by our
            third party partners. Web beacons are used along with cookies
            enabling our partners to compile aggregated statistics to analyze
            how our site is used.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use a third party to gather information about how you and others
            use our Web site. For example, we will know how many users access a
            specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this
            aggregated information to understand and optimize how our site is
            used.

          <h4>
            Disclosure under the Mandatory Data Breach Notification Scheme
          </h4>
          <p>
            Under Part IIIC of <em>the Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth), we are
            required by law to notify you and the Office of the Australian
            Information Commissioner if:
          </p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              there is unauthorised access to, or unauthorised disclosure of,
              personal information we hold; and
            </li>
            <li>
              a reasonable person would conclude that the access or disclosure
              would be likely to result in serious harm to any of the
              individuals to whom the information relates;
            </li>
            <span class="bt_ol">OR</span>
            <li>
              information is lost in circumstances where there is likely to be
              unauthorised access to, or unauthosed disclosure of, that
              information; and
            </li>
            <li>
              if that unauthorised access or disclosure were to occur, a
              reasonable person would conclude that the access or disclosure
              would be likely to result in serious harm to any of the
              individuals to whom the information relates.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Unless an exemption under the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth)
            applies, we will notify you of any breach of your privacy. We will
            also share the existence and nature of the breach with the Office of
            the Australian Information Commissioner.
          </p>
          <p>
            That notification will take the form of a Breach Statement and may
            contain details of the information (including the information
            itself) which has been effected by the unauthorised disclosure,
            access or loss.
          </p>
          <h4>Compliance with Other Laws and Legal Processes</h4>
          <p>We may also disclose your personal information</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar
              legal process
            </li>
            <li>
              when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
              protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
              investigate fraud;
            </li>
            <li>
              if Webprofits is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all
              or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or
              a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or
              uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may
              have regarding your personal information at that time.

            may differ from those of Webprofits. If you submit personal

            steps to keep that information secure and safe from the risk of
            external or internal unauthorised access or disclosure.
          </p>
          <p>The measures we employ are divided into 3 classes:</p>
          <ol>

            <li>protection from external risks; and</li>

          <p>

            of information from internal sources, we:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>

              access in order to perform their duties;
            </li>

            <li>
              implement policies and procedures with respect to the use of
              information, including procedures as to how work is performed to
              ensure consistency with privacy principles.

          </ol>
          <p><em>External Risks</em></p>
          <p>

            </li>
            <li>
              prohibit third-party personnel from accessing areas of our
              premises in which information is stored; and

          <p>

          <ol>
            <li>maintain updated information-technology platforms;</li>
            <li>regularly change passwords;</li>
            <li>

              information-technology;
            </li>
            <li>
